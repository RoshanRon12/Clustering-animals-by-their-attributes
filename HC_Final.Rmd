# Data Understanding

We will work on a dataset on Zoo animals. We want to cluster the animals by their attributes.

More information on the data can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/zoo)

We work with these attributes:

1. animal name
2. hair
3. feathers
4. eggs
5. milk
6. airborne
7. aquatic
8. predator
9. toothed
10. backbone
11. breathes
12. venomous
13. fins
14. legs
15. tail
16. domestic
17. catsize
18. type

Our target variable "type" has 7 classes with integer values of 1 to 7.

These numbers represent these groups:

1 -- (41) aardvark, antelope, bear, boar, buffalo, calf, cavy, cheetah, deer, dolphin, elephant, fruitbat, giraffe, girl, goat, gorilla, hamster, hare, leopard, lion, lynx, mink, mole, mongoose, opossum, oryx, platypus, polecat, pony, porpoise, puma, pussycat, raccoon, reindeer, seal, sealion, squirrel, vampire, vole, wallaby,wolf 
2 -- (20) chicken, crow, dove, duck, flamingo, gull, hawk, kiwi, lark, ostrich, parakeet, penguin, pheasant, rhea, skimmer, skua, sparrow, swan, vulture, wren 
3 -- (5) pitviper, seasnake, slowworm, tortoise, tuatara 
4 -- (13) bass, carp, catfish, chub, dogfish, haddock, herring, pike, piranha, seahorse, sole, stingray, tuna 
5 -- (4) frog, frog, newt, toad 
6 -- (8) flea, gnat, honeybee, housefly, ladybird, moth, termite, wasp 
7 -- (10) clam, crab, crayfish, lobster, octopus, scorpion, seawasp, slug, starfish, worm

# Data Preparation

## Data Download

```{r}
# if file does not exist, download it first
file_path <- "./data/zoo.csv"
if (!file.exists(file_path)) { 
  dir.create("./data")
  url <- "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/zoo/zoo.data"
  download.file(url = url, 
                destfile = file_path)
}

zoo_raw <- read.csv(file = file_path)
```

## Setting column names

```{r}
colnames(zoo_raw) <- c("animal_name", "hair", "feathers", "eggs", "milk", "airborne", "aquatic", "predator", "toothed", "backbone", "breathes",    "venomous",  "fins","legs", "tail", "domestic", "catsize", "class_type" )
```

Now there is no missing data any more.

## Data Manipulation

```{r}
summary(zoo_raw)
```

There are no NA's that need to be handled. There are 17 attributes and one class attribute.

There are 101 observations which belong to these classes.

```{r}
table(zoo_raw$class_type)
```



```{r}
file_class <- "./data/class.csv"
class_names <- read_csv(file_class) %>% as_tibble()
class_names %>% 
  dplyr::select(Class_Number, Class_Type)
```

## Scaling

We don't know if all variables are comparable in mean and standard deviation. Actually it is rather unlikely. So we scale our data.

```{r}
zoo_mat_scaled <- zoo_raw %>% 
  dplyr::filter(animal_name != "frog") 
rownames(zoo_mat_scaled) <- zoo_mat_scaled$animal_name
zoo_mat_scaled <- zoo_mat_scaled %>% 
select (-animal_name, -class_type) %>% 
  scale
```


# Model

Now we can work on hierarchical clustering.

## Distance Matrix

We need to calculate a distance matrix, which hold distances from all points to all other points.

```{r}
distance_mat <- dist(zoo_mat_scaled, 
                     method = "euclidean")
```

## Model Creation

We perform hierarchical clustering based on our distance matrix and complete linkage. We plot the result and 

```{r}
hc <- hclust(d = distance_mat, method = "complete")
```

## Cluster Number

### Dendrogram

Based on dendrogram we can make a decision on number of clusters.

```{r}
plot(hc)
rect.hclust(tree = hc, k = 7, border = 1:2)
```

### Elbow Method

We can also use elbow method, that we used for kmeans before.

```{r}
fviz_nbclust(zoo_mat_scaled, FUN = hcut, method = "wss")
```

Based on elbow method four cluster should be chosen.

## Dendrogram Comparison

```{r}
hc_complete <- hclust(d = distance_mat, method = "complete") %>% as.dendrogram
hc_single <- hclust(d = distance_mat, method = "single") %>% as.dendrogram
tanglegram(hc_complete, hc_single, 
           highlight_distinct_edges = FALSE, # Turn-off dashed lines
  common_subtrees_color_lines = FALSE, # Turn-off line colors
  common_subtrees_color_branches = TRUE # Color common branches 
)

```

Two dendrograms can be plotted and their labels are connected. This directly shows similarities and differences between models.

```{r}
Rowv <- rowMeans(zoo_mat_scaled, na.rm=T)
hc_reordered <- reorder(as.dendrogram(hc), Rowv)
heatmap(x = zoo_mat_scaled, Rowv = hc_reordered, )
```

## Visualisation

```{r}
hc_cut <- cutree(tree = hc, k = 7)
fviz_cluster(list(data = zoo_mat_scaled, 
                  cluster =hc_cut))
```
