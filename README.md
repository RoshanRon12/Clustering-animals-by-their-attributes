# Clustering-animals-by-their-attributes

We will work on a dataset on Zoo animals. We want to cluster the animals by their attributes.

More information on the data can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/zoo)

We work with these attributes:

1. animal name
2. hair
3. feathers
4. eggs
5. milk
6. airborne
7. aquatic
8. predator
9. toothed
10. backbone
11. breathes
12. venomous
13. fins
14. legs
15. tail
16. domestic
17. catsize
18. type

Our target variable "type" has 7 classes with integer values of 1 to 7.

These numbers represent these groups:

1 -- (41) aardvark, antelope, bear, boar, buffalo, calf, cavy, cheetah, deer, dolphin, elephant, fruitbat, giraffe, girl, goat, gorilla, hamster, hare, leopard, lion, lynx, mink, mole, mongoose, opossum, oryx, platypus, polecat, pony, porpoise, puma, pussycat, raccoon, reindeer, seal, sealion, squirrel, vampire, vole, wallaby,wolf 
2 -- (20) chicken, crow, dove, duck, flamingo, gull, hawk, kiwi, lark, ostrich, parakeet, penguin, pheasant, rhea, skimmer, skua, sparrow, swan, vulture, wren 
3 -- (5) pitviper, seasnake, slowworm, tortoise, tuatara 
4 -- (13) bass, carp, catfish, chub, dogfish, haddock, herring, pike, piranha, seahorse, sole, stingray, tuna 
5 -- (4) frog, frog, newt, toad 
6 -- (8) flea, gnat, honeybee, housefly, ladybird, moth, termite, wasp 
7 -- (10) clam, crab, crayfish, lobster, octopus, scorpion, seawasp, slug, starfish, worm


# In this we have the domain knowledge and know that there are seven classes. Assume we don't know this. We want to find out if the Elbow method guides us to the same conclusion
